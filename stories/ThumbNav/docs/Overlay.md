The `ThumbNav` component can be used as overlay in photo galleries, for instance.
The father element of the `ThumbNav` component is required to have the class `.position-relative` in order to get the right positioning of the overlay.

For further information about this use case, we link the [official documentation](https://italia.github.io/bootstrap-italia/docs/menu-di-navigazione/thumbnav/#posizione-in-overlay).

The active elment of the component is highlighted by means of the attribute `active`.
